## dafne/toolVersion ##
Dafne is a program for the segmentation of medical images, specifically MR images, that includes advanced deep learning models for an automatic segmentation. The user has the option of refining the automated results, and the software will learn from the improvements and modify its internal models accordingly. In order to continuously improve the performance, the deep learning modules are stored in a central server location.

Example:
```
dafne
